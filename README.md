# Hi, I'm [Artha](https://git.samerion.com/Artha)!

I'm developing a big MMO game a sane person probably wouldn't work on alone, [Samerion](https://samerion.com). The game itself is closed, but is built upon a few small libraries you're entirely free to use. See them all on [git.samerion.com](https://git.samerion.com/Samerion) (collaborations are welcome)!

**Note:** I am visiting GitHub less and less nowadays, moving activity to my Gitea instance. 

Want to get in contact? Find me on Mastodon: https://mstdn.social/@Soaku or e-mail me at <mailto:artha@samerion.com>.
